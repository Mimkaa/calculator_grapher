First of all if you are reading this, I am really honored to have someone iterested in my project!!! Whithout firther do let go to the business.

This is a program which can perform 2 functions: of a calculator and of a graph drawer.

Let me describe first the functionel of the grapher:
	by pressing (SPACE): function input is toggled, you can enter any exprecion with a the letter 'x' (it can be something intricate like: tan() or exp(), to make long story short it can 
	it can draw anithing python`s module math can offer and even its combinations).
	
	Next you have to hit (Enter) and it toggles RGB(color) input you can enter any RGB or if you pass it the graph will be created in a random color.

	Lastly hit (Enter) second time to build the actual thing

	By pressing L -  you will draw the legend of the graphs you have made.
	
	By pressing Arrow keys(Up, Down)-you can scale the graph 
	
	The last thing - You can point your mouse on any graph to see the coords at this point

Calculator:
	I think that this thing is self-explainatory, the only feature I created was that if the input or the result is bigger than the screen you can scroll the screen up and down ro see the complete thing.
